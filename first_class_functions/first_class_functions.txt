A programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions 
as first-class citizens.

First-Class-Citizen(s) in programming:
A first class citizen (sometimes called first-time objects) in a programming language is an entity
which supports all operations generally available to other entities.
These operations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a function 
and assigned to a variable.

for example, in Python,                         for example in Javascript,

def square(s):                                  function square(x) {                                                return x*x
    return s**2                                     return x*x
                                                }
d = square(5)                                   var f = square(5)
print(square)                                   console.log(square)                
print(d)                                        console.log(f)

A first class function would be,
e = square      <--#First class functions-->    var r = square
print(e(5))                                     console.log(r(5))

A map function available in both languages is also a first class function.
squares = map(square, [1,2,3,4,5])
