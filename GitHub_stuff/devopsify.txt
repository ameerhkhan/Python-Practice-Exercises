Best ways to increase productivity is to automate.

Through the magic of DevOps.

What is Github Actions?

1 - Continous Integration:
--------------------------
Have developers contribute to main application in small maintainable chunks.

github/workflows/ --> anything in this directory will be picked up by Github and automatically setup as a workflow 
in the cloud
INTEGRATE.YML, --> Here we will define the workflow
name: Node Continous Integration # --> Give it a name.

# tell which events to run using 'on' object,

on:
    pull_request:
        branches: [ master ]


# Every workflow should have one or more jobs defined in the following job object.

jobs:
    test_pull_request: #name of job
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest              # which VM to run on>
        steps:                              # set of steps/instructions that actually build and test our code.
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2     # get the source code into the current working directory.
            - uses: actions/setup-node@v1   # setup node js and specify version
            with:
                node-version: 12
            - run: npm ci          # equivalent to npm install, to install dependencies.
            - run: npm test        # test our code
            - run: npm run build   # build command.


Create a new branch using

> git checkout -b testing
> git add .
> git commit -m 'This should fail it'


2 - Continous Deployment:
-------------------------

Pushing Code out to the customer.

Create new file in same workflow directory,
github/workflow/deploy.YML
"""
jobs:
    deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@master
            - uses: actions/setup-node@master
                with:
                node-version: 12
            - run: npm ci
            - run: npm run build
            - uses: w9jds/firebase-action@master
                with:
                    args: deploy --only hosting
                env:
                    FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }} #the secret token.

> git add .
> git commit -m "cd workflow"
> push origin master


3 - Publish NPM Packages.
